&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you begin using OIL you will need to compile the Fuel 
installer and place a copy in the App path of the Oil Project.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="Creating Oil Files"><font size="4">Creating Oil Files</font></a></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oil will create a package of the Update list and Files into a 
folder for distribution.<br>
Run Oil to begin creating the update package. When Oil creates an update package 
the package will consist of:</p>

<p>A folder with the name of your application followed by &quot;Oil&quot;&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; 
MyAppOil<br>
this folder will contain:<br>
1. A text list of the files to be installed and where. (install.oil)<br>
2. A folder named &quot;Files&quot; containing the files for updating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a Zipped folder named &quot;Files.zip&quot; of you selected to 
compile the files.<br>
3. A copy of the Fuel Installer.<br>
4. A .gif image representing your App that will show up on the Fuel Installer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Finding the App to Package">Finding the App to 
Package</a></font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you run Oil the first thing you must do is determine is 
what app you are going to update.<br>
Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button and locate the compiled app.<br>
Oil reads the App's file information and gets the Name and version. <br>
It is important the you package the newest version of your .exe.<br>
Oil will remember any previous selection, which can be chosen from the combo 
box.</p>

<p>&nbsp; If you created a setup/installation with VB's Package and Deployment 
Wizard,&nbsp; Oil can tell the Fuel Installer to <br>
update the uninstall log - ST6UNST.LOG for you new files.<br>
&nbsp; The EXE is NOT added to the uninstall log - ST6UNST.LOG when selecting 
this option, it already exists.</p>

<p><br>
<b><font size="4"><a name="Where to install from">Where to install from</a></font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must&nbsp; determine 
where the Update file are located.</p>

<p><i><b>Installing from the web</b></i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose &quot;Install from the web&quot; if the update files are to be 
placed on a web sever. <br>
You will be prompted for the URl of these files.&nbsp; You will need to enter the 
full URL including subfolders.<br>
You can upload the &quot;Files&quot; folder created by Oil to the server.&nbsp; Make sure 
the URL ends with a &quot;/&quot;.<br>
When the Fuel Installer runs it will download and install the files from the 
URL.&nbsp; Once The installation is complete Fuel will delete the downloaded 
files. You will not be able to zip the files if you chose this option. The Fuel 
installer doesn't have the ability to uncompress zip files at this time.</p>

<p><i><b>Installing form a File</b></i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose &quot;Install from a File&quot; if the update files are to be 
put on a disk or downloaded as a Zip file.<br>
The Fuel Installer will not delete the files after installation.&nbsp; If 
&quot;Installed from File&quot; the &quot;Files&quot; folder created by Oil <br>
must be in the same Directory or App.path as the Fuel Installer.</p>

<p><b>Do not change the &quot;Files&quot; folder to a different name.&nbsp; The Fuel 
installer looks for the &quot;Files&quot; folder.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="Create Folders"><font size="4">Creating Folders</font></a></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have select where to install the files from you will be prompted 
for creating any new folders/directories for this update.<br>
The new folders will be placed in your applications directory.&nbsp; An example 
might be that you didn't include any help files with your original release and 
now you have some Html help pages that that need to be place in a &quot;Help&quot; folder 
inside your App's Directory. <br>
Enter the folder names in to the textbox and click &quot;Create New Folder&quot;.&nbsp; If 
you need no new folders click &quot;Next&quot;. Repeat as needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Adding Files">&nbsp;Adding Files</a></font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking the &quot;Add Files&quot; button will open a dialog 
window in which you can select the files you need for this update, adding them 
to the List.&nbsp; The EXE you selected to package should appear first in the 
list. Don't remove it, it would be bad. Continue until all the file need for 
this update are added.&nbsp; As you add files you are prompted for their 
installation location by the &quot;Where&quot; window.<br>
With your choices being:<br>
<b><i>AppPath: </i></b>Your Application's Directory<br>
&nbsp;<b><i>System: </i></b>Window's System Folder <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select this for system files such as ocx's and dll's.&nbsp; 
Files with this install location will be registered by the Fuel installer.<br>
<b><i>New Folder: </i></b>If you previously created any new folders they will 
appear as a option.<br>
<br>
To remove a file, highlight it and uncheck the box.<b><br>
Note:&nbsp; It is important NOT to include any files that were part of an 
earlier installation or update.<br>
</b>Why? <br>
1. You don't need to install them, they already exist.<br>
2. The Fuel overwrites any existing files.&nbsp; <br>
3. If you selected to update the uninstall log. You could create duplicate 
entries, causing the App to uninstall improperly.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Add an Icon">Add an Icon</a></font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may select to add a icon/image to the Fuel installer that 
represent your application.&nbsp; The image must be in the form of a GIF and 
should have a transparent background.&nbsp; The Image must not be larger than 55 
x 55 pixels.&nbsp; You do not have to select an image.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Saving the Files">Saving the Files</a></b></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have added all the files that are required for the 
update.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Next&quot; button. <br>
Select where to save the OIL package. You can chose to have the &quot;Files&quot; folder 
compressed into a Zip format (Thanks to OldManMarcin). The Fuel installer and 
the Icon you selected will not be included in the Zip folder.
The package will be saved in a&nbsp;folder with the name of your application 
followed by &quot;Oil&quot;&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; MyAppOil</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Fuel Installer">Fuel Installer</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></font>The Fuel Installer will not run alone it needs an 
&quot;install.oil&quot; text file to read.&nbsp; To test the Fuel installer, Run Oil and 
create a sample update for an existing Application.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be 
recommended to run VB's package and deployment&nbsp; wizard and install your App before trying to update 
it.&nbsp; If you run the App from the VB IDE and then 
run the Fuel Installer you may overwrite files you did not intend to.</p>
